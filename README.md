# Automating Crypto Web API Pull 
In this project we will be using "https://coinmarketcap.com/" a website that tracks cryptocurrencies.

NOTE: Make sure to read through the CoinMarketCap Documentation "https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/"

NOTE: !YOU WILL HAVE TO GENERATE AND USE YOUR OWN API KEY FROM YOUR CoinMarketCap Account! "https://coinmarketcap.com/api/"

Steps to get started with the project:
1. Go to "https://coinmarketcap.com/api/" to signn up for a free Developer Portal Account
2. Create and generate your own API key
3. Use the sandbox template provided and change the "X_CMC_PRO_API_KEY:" to your own generated API Key
4. Change the URL to "pro-api.coinmarketcap.com"
5. Make a test call using your API Key which fetches all active cryptocurrencies by market cap and return market values in USD
